# Conway's Game of Life

This program uses Pygame to simulate [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The rules are simple:
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Usage

To run, ensure Pygame is installed and run `main.py` as a python file.

## Controls
